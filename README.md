# About
This project is a weather site with HTML, CSS and JS. The API is from Open-Meteo.

# Features
The website returns the name of the city, country, current temperature, humidity, wind speed, maximum and minimum temperatures, along with an icon corresponding to the weather condition (sun, rain, cloudy, or night). The background of the page changes according to the time of day (day or night), and the weather forecast for the next six days is also displayed.
